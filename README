This program reads the roms sub-directories for gamelist.xml files and checks for the existence of a manual tag in the xml file.
If the manual tag does not exist and there is a manual file in the media/manuals directory with the same name as the game
it adds a <manual> xml tag to the xml file.  If it doesn't find a manual file it writes the game name to missing_manuals.txt.
Run this program in the roms directory

Skraper can scrape game manuals but for some reason it doesn't add
the path to the manual as an xml tag in gamelist.xml.  If you hav
scraped manuals with Skraper you can run this app in the rom
folder to add them all to the gamelist.xml files
You only need to do this once until you add more games and run
Skraper again

A -r option will remove the manual tags if it points to media/manuals
This is useful to test the add function or add again from sc
-r will not remove any manual tags that do not point to the media/manuals director
as the add routine will only add manual tags back in that are in the media/manuals directory
This is to prevent removing manual tags that were added manually or in some other way
For example the manual tags in PICOwesome point to a different directory and the gamelist.xm
is created using his own program specially made for PICOwesome
